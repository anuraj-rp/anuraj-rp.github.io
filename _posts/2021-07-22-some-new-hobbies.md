I have been on hiatus from Robotics for quite some time. The last time I worked with some field robots was in 2015. Around the end of last year ESA released a mini version of the ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover that is going to launch next year.

This got me excited as I could start building this rover and have fun playing with this toy rover. The software stack uses ROS which I last played with in 2014. 

The global pandemic has restricted travel for more than an year and it seems traveling would limited for atleast one more year. I think this is a good time to start a new hobby of building small robots and rovers and end my hiatus from robotics. 

I hope to document the progress on a blog and on a YouTube channel. Let's see how far I can get building this rover.
