Last month I finished up a year in the world of exploring youtube and video editing. I tried a lot of things in the last one year and spent quite some money on different gears and trying out different software. One of the obvious things one realizes after jumping into video world is that it is way harder than it looks. Creating good content that people would like to watch is hard on a consitent basis. But I want to continue this experiment and see where it goes. 

Last year I tried a lot of software and gear and made a lot of cringe content(lol). Here is the list of the things I have tried
