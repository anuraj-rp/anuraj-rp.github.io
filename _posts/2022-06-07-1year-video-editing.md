Last month I finished one year in the world of YouTube and exploring video editing. One of the obvious things one immediately realizes after jumping into video world is that it is way harder than it looks to create good video content. There are so many skills required for making good video content that I was just overwhelmed for the first 3-4 months. 

But I have taken tiny steps, and moving forward really slowly. I could go faster if I was doing this full time. I tried a lot of things in the last one year and spent quite some money on different gears and trying out different software and video platforms. I made a lot of cringe content too, lol. 

Some of the things I tried:

### Gear

* **DJI Pocket 2** <br/>
  It was a really good buy I think. It shoots in 4K and has a gimbal. The best thing about it is that it fits into my pocket. :D
* **Selfie stick** with tripod and iPhone <br/>
  I have filming a lot with my iPhone too, so a simple tripod and selfie stick was useful
* **Gaming Laptop** <br/>
  Another good buy. I thought I could edit with my old computer but it was just not powerful enough for full 4K video editing. So now I have a ASUS Zephyrus G14 Gaming Laptop  
* **Tripod** <br/>
  A good camera tripod. Haven't used it much except the monopod stand from one of its legs which I used for the DJI Pocket 2

### Software

* **Descript** <br/>
  I used it in the beginning when I started. Really good transcription based editing feature. I wasn't using it much so I canceled my subscription. It doesn't have all the features of a full video editing software it seems.
* **Davinci Resolve** <br/>
  Free full fledged video editing software and steeper learning curve. I use it right now for all my editing.
* **Canva** <br/>
  Good software for all graphics needs. I use it mostly to make YouTube thumbnails.
* **OBS Studio** <br/>
  Live Streaming and Screen Recording. Lots of feature and takes some time to get used to it.
* **Twitch Studio** <br/>
  Tried it a few times to stream to Twitch my coding sessions. Easy to use.
* **Filmic Pro for iPhone** <br/>
  Good software for iPhone for filming. Another phone can be used as a remote if they are on the same wifi. Good buy.
* **Luma Fusion for iOS** <br/>
  Bought a few weeks ago. Trying it out now. 

### Video Platoform

* **Youtube** <br/>
  I am mostly editing The Yak Collective channel. The content is created during our weekly meetings which I edit before uploading.
* **Instagram** <br/>
  Tried out some travel videos on my personal instagram. Video editing tools inbuilt into instagram are good for stories. But auto suggested things like reels on instagram still not good as TikTok.
* **TikTok** <br/>
  The suggested videos after browsing it only for some time is quite good. 
* **Twitch** <br/>
  Learning to stream my coding session. Feels live streaming is going to be much bigger in the coming decade.

A lot of my weekends during the last one year has been going into trying out all the different software, gear and platforms. I haven't much progress on the content creation and don't have much to show for the amount of time I have spent on this. But I hope to keep continuing to learn as much as I can about video editing and content creation. I enjoy video editing, so let's see where I will be next year.
