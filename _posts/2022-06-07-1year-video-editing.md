Last month I finished one year in the world of YouTube and exploring video editing. One of the obvious things one immediately realizes after jumping into video world is that it is way harder than it looks to create good video content. There are so many skills required for making good video content that I was just overwhelmed for the first 3-4 months. 

But I have taken tiny steps, and moving forward but really slowly. I could go faster if I was doing this full time. I tried a lot of things in the last one year and spent quite some money on different gears and trying out different software and video platforms. I made a lot of cringe content too, lol. 

Some of the things I tried:

### Gear

* DJI Pocket 2
  It was a really good buy I think. It shoots in 4K and has a gimbal. The best thing about it is that it fits into my pocket. :D
* Selfie stick with tripod and iPhone
  I have filming a lot with my iPhone too, so a simple tripod and selfie stick was useful
* Gaming Laptop
  Another good buy. I thought I could edit with my old computer but it was just not powerfull enough for full 4K video editing. So now I have a ASUS Zephyrus G14 Gaming Laptop  
* Tripod
  A good camera tripod. Haven't used it much except the monopod stand from one of its legs which I used for the DJI Pocket 2

### Software

* Descript
  I used it in the beginning when I started. Really good transcription based editing feature. But once I wasn't using it much so I canceled my subscription. It doesn't have all the features of a full video editing software
* Davincie Resolve
  Free full fledged video editing software and steeper learning curve. I use it right now for all my editing
* Canva
  Good software for all graphics needs. I use it mostly to make YouTube thumbnails
* OBS Studio
  Live Streaming and Screen Recording. Lots of feature and takes some time to get used to it.
* Twitch Studio
  Tried it a few times to stream to Twitch my coding sessions. Easy to use
* Filmic Pro for iPhone
  Good software for iPhone for filming with remote in another phoen on the same wifi. Good buy.
* Luma Fusion for iOS
  Bought a few weeks ago. Trying it out now. 

### Video Platoform

* Youtube
  I am mostly editing The Yak Collective channel. The content is created during our weekly meetings which I edit before uploading
* Instagram
  Tried out some travel videos on my personal instagram. Vidoe editing tools inbuilt into instagram are good for stories. But auto suggested things reels instagram experience still not good as TikTok
* TikTok
  The suggested videos after browsing it only for some time is just quite good. 
* Twitch
  Learning to stream my coding session. Feels live streaming is going to be much bigger in the coming decade.
