# Cryptobotics - The New Robotics Frontier? 

I have been exploring blockchains for the last few years and its application to Robotics and Internet of Things. There are many people experimenting with blockchains for Robotics around the world. Everyone just described this field of study with different word combinations involving blockchains and robotics. I never found a name for this new emerging field that would capture vibe of the field. While thinking about it I randomly posted on [Farcaster][Farcaster] - a web3 social media platform, a possible name for this new field which seems to have resonated a bit with people.

I think Cryptobotics broadly captures what the field is all about - decentralization, distributed, blockchains, smart contracts, zk-proofs, cryptocurrencies and robotics. 

The time for Cryptobotics arrived as Bitcoin breaches the previous all time high today.
