# Cryptobotics - A New Robotics Frontier? 

Some of my friends and I have been exploring blockchains for the last few years at [Yak Robotics Garage][yarg] for its application to Robotics and Internet of Things. There are many people experimenting with blockchains for Robotics around the world, but everybody just describes this new emerging field of study with different word combinations involving blockchains and robotics. I never found a name that would capture the vibe of the field. While thinking about it I randomly posted on [Farcaster][farcaster], a possible name for this new field which seems to have resonated a bit with people.

I think Cryptobotics broadly captures the vibe and what the field is all about - permissionless-ness, decentralization, distributed systems, blockchains, smart-contracts, zk-proofs, zk-SNARKS, cryptocurrencies and robotics. 

The time for Cryptobotics has arrived and as Marc Andreessen would say _"It's time to build" - Cryptobots_. 

Infact we at [Yak Robotics Garage][yarg] built a small FPV cryptobot controlled with [Farcaster][farcaster] frames and are briging it to Devcon in Bangkok. 

So if you want to play with our cryptobots, come meet us at Devcon. Follow us on Farcaster/Twitter to know where we have setup our cryptobots. We are [vgr][vgr] and [anurajenp][anurajenp] on Farcaster/Twitter.
